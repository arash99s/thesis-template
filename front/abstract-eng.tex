Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a leading approach in user data protection that guarantees privacy without requiring trust in the aggregator. This concept enables data analysis by injecting noise into user data prior to transmission to the aggregator. Privacy-preserving data utilization is critical in sensitive domains such as healthcare and the Internet of Things (IoT); utilizing these resources for key decision-making processes requires guaranteeing that personal information remains uncompromised during analysis. This research focuses on preserving Local Differential Privacy in high-dimensional and evolving data. Key challenges in this domain include feature correlation, increased data sensitivity, and rapid consumption of the privacy budget, all of which can severely degrade the accuracy and efficiency of statistical analyses. In addition to categorizing, reviewing, and comparing existing algorithms and prior works, this study proposes a novel solution for preserving privacy in high-dimensional and evolving data.

The primary innovation of this research lies in the integration of the Haar Transform and the Alpha-point Rounding mechanism. Data is first decomposed using the Haar Transform to concentrate the majority of information within a limited number of coefficients; this process facilitates more optimal management of the privacy budget. To manage dynamic data, the Alpha-point Rounding mechanism is employed. Unlike traditional methods that require budget consumption for every minor change, this solution eliminates insignificant and transient fluctuations (jitter), thereby guaranteeing the stability of user responses over time and preventing privacy budget wastage. The performance of the proposed solution has been evaluated through implementation and comparison with established methods. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only preserves privacy but also provides superior utility for statistical analyses.
